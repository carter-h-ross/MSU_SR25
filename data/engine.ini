POWER_CURVE=power.lut			; power curve file
COAST_CURVE=FROM_COAST_REF 		; coast curve. can define 3 different options (coast reference, coast values for mathematical curve, coast curve file)

[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1		; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.0120					; engine inertia
LIMITER=1818					; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=240
MINIMUM=1

[COAST_REF]
RPM=2000						; rev number reference
TORQUE=100						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY=0					; coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.99				; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.992				; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=0.0 				; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=0.0				; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=0.0		; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=2000			; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=1.0
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0

[DAMAGE]
TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD=1.5  ; level of TOTAL boost before the engine starts to take damage
TURBO_DAMAGE_K=5			; amount of damage per second per (boost - threshold)
RPM_THRESHOLD=2000			; RPM at which the engine starts to take damage
RPM_DAMAGE_K=1
